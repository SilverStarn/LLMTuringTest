    <div id="text-container">
      <p class="about-game">The Imitation Game is another name for the Turing test, created by English computer
        scientist, Alan Turing. A Turing test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit human-level intelligence. A
        classical Turing test involves an interrogator, a responder, and a machine. The interrogator poses questions to
        the responder and the machine. The interrogator's objective is to determine which response was generated by the
        machine. A machine that could pass as the responder is said to have "passed" the Turing test. That is, if the
        interrogator is unable to distinguish between the responses of the machine and the human responder, that machine
        can be thought of as intelligent.</p>

      <p class="about-game">Alan Turing is widely considered the "father" of artificial intelligence. Turing devised the
        test as evidence for the proposition that machines can think. Turing argued that thinking itself was difficult
        to define, and proposed that machine intelligence should be measured in a different way. We are to simulate modern-day Turing tests on this website so we can meassure how much our current LLMs can mimic humans</p>
